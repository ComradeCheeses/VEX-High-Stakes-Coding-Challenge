Welcome to the VEX High Stakes Coding Challenge!
You have been provided starter code that you will be editing to complete 2 tasks.
First, start with task 1, then move on to task 2 if time permits.
Reminder: If you are caught cheating (talking during the test or accessing resources other than the LemLib Documentation), your test will be terminated and you will most likely not be considered for the position of Coder.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
Good Luck!
